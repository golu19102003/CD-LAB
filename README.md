Compiler Design Lab
The Compiler Design lab is a hands-on course that focuses on the design and implementation of compilers. Students learn to analyze and design algorithms for various phases of compilation, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

Objectives:
1. Understand the basics of compiler design and implementation.
2. Learn to analyze and design algorithms for various phases of compilation.
3. Implement a compiler for a given programming language.
4. Understand the trade-offs between different design choices.

Lab Components:
1. Lexical Analysis: Implement a lexer to recognize tokens in the source code.
2. Syntax Analysis: Implement a parser to analyze the syntax of the source code.
3. Semantic Analysis: Implement a semantic analyzer to check the semantics of the source code.
4. Optimization: Implement optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of the generated code.
5. Code Generation: Implement a code generator to generate machine code from the intermediate representation.

Tools and Technologies:
1. Programming Languages: C.
2. Compiler Construction Tools: Lex, Yacc, ANTLR.
3. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Eclipse, Visual Studio.

Assignments and Projects:
1. Lexer Implementation: Implement a lexer for a given programming language.
2. Parser Implementation: Implement a parser for a given programming language.
3. Semantic Analyzer Implementation: Implement a semantic analyzer for a given programming language.
4. Compiler Implementation: Implement a compiler for a given programming language.
5. Project: Implement a compiler for a given programming language, including all phases of compilation.
