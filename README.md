The **Compiler Design Lab** as per Rajasthan Technical University (RTU) curriculum is a practical-oriented course designed to provide students with hands-on experience in the fundamental concepts and techniques involved in compiler construction. This lab complements the theoretical knowledge gained in the Compiler Design theory course by enabling students to implement and experiment with various compiler components and tools.The Compiler Design lab is a hands-on course that focuses on the design and implementation of compilers. Students learn to analyze and design algorithms for various phases of compilation, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

### Objective
The primary objective of this lab is to familiarize students with the design and implementation of language processors by exploring lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization techniques. Students will gain practical skills in using tools like **LEX** and **YACC** to automate parts of the compiler construction process. The lab emphasizes understanding the internal working of compilers and the translation of high-level programming languages into executable code.
1. Understand the basics of compiler design and implementation.
2. Learn to analyze and design algorithms for various phases of compilation.
3. Implement a compiler for a given programming language.
4. Understand the trade-offs between different design choices.

### Scope
The lab covers a wide range of compiler design topics including:
- Construction of lexical analyzers using regular expressions and finite automata.
- Implementation of parsers such as recursive descent, LL(1), operator precedence, and SLR parsers.
- Development of syntax-directed translation schemes and parse trees.
- Generation of intermediate code forms like three-address code.
- Symbol table management and heap storage allocation simulation.
- Use of compiler tools (LEX and YACC) for lexical and syntax analysis.
- Basic code optimization techniques and understanding of activation records.

### Lab Components:
1. Lexical Analysis: Implement a lexer to recognize tokens in the source code.
2. Syntax Analysis: Implement a parser to analyze the syntax of the source code.
3. Semantic Analysis: Implement a semantic analyzer to check the semantics of the source code.
4. Optimization: Implement optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of the generated code.
5. Code Generation: Implement a code generator to generate machine code from the intermediate representation.

### Tools and Technologies:
1. Programming Languages: C.
2. Compiler Construction Tools: Lex, Yacc, ANTLR.
3. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Eclipse, Visual Studio.

### Assignments and Projects:
1. Lexer Implementation: Implement a lexer for a given programming language.
2. Parser Implementation: Implement a parser for a given programming language.
3. Semantic Analyzer Implementation: Implement a semantic analyzer for a given programming language.
4. Compiler Implementation: Implement a compiler for a given programming language.
5. Project: Implement a compiler for a given programming language, including all phases of compilation.

### Evaluation:
1. Assignments: 5%
2. Projects & Implementation Lab Programs: 50%
3. Midterm Exam: 10%
4. Final Exam: 35%

### Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this lab, students will be able to:
- Understand and implement lexical analyzers and parsers for given grammars.
- Analyze and construct parse trees and syntax trees.
- Develop programs that perform syntax-directed translation and intermediate code generation.
- Use compiler construction tools (LEX and YACC) effectively.
- Implement code optimization and memory allocation strategies.
- Gain insight into compiler phases such as scanning, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.
- Write efficient programs that simulate real-world compiler components.

### Typical Experiments:
- Writing lexical analyzers to recognize tokens like keywords, identifiers, operators.
- Implementing top-down and bottom-up parsing algorithms.
- Generating intermediate code and three-address code.
- Simulating heap storage allocation.
- Creating symbol tables and managing scope.
- Using LEX and YACC to automate lexical and syntax analysis.

### Importance:
This lab bridges the gap between compiler theory and practical implementation, preparing students for advanced topics in language processing and system programming. It also builds a strong foundation for research or careers in compiler development, programming language design, and software engineering.
